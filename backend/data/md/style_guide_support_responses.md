# Support Response Style Guide

## Tone

*   **Empathetic & Professional:** Acknowledge the user's issue and maintain a helpful, professional tone.
*   **Clear & Concise:** Avoid jargon. Get straight to the point. Use simple language.
*   **Positive Language:** Frame solutions positively where possible (e.g., "You can do this by..." instead of "You can't do that, but...").

## Formatting

*   **Greeting:** Use a polite greeting (e.g., "Hi [Customer Name]," or "Hello,").
*   **Acknowledgement:** Briefly restate or acknowledge the issue. ("I understand you're having trouble with...")
*   **Numbered/Bulleted Lists:** Use for steps or multiple points.
*   **Code/Commands:** Use backticks (\`) for inline code or triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks.
*   **Links:** Use descriptive link text (e.g., `[Password Reset Page](link)` instead of just the raw URL).
*   **Closing:** Use a helpful closing (e.g., "Let me know if that helps!", "Best regards,").
*   **Signature:** Include your name and title/team.
